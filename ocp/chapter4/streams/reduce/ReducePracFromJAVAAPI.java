	A reduction operation (also called a fold) takes a sequence of input elements and combines them 
	into a single summary result by repeated application of a combining operation, 
	such as finding the sum or maximum of a set of numbers, or accumulating elements into a list. 
	The streams classes have multiple forms of general reduction operations, called reduce() and collect(),
	 as well as multiple specialized reduction forms such as sum(), max(), or count().

	Of course, such operations can be readily implemented as simple sequential loops, as in:


    int sum = 0;
    for (int x : numbers) {
       sum += x;
    }
 
	However, there are good reasons to prefer a reduce operation over a mutative accumulation 
	such as the above. Not only is a reduction "more abstract" -- it operates on the stream as a whole 
	rather than individual elements -- but a properly constructed reduce operation is 
	inherently parallelizable, so long as the function(s) used to process the elements are associative 
	and stateless. For example, given a stream of numbers for which we want to find the sum, we can write:

    int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, (x,y) -> x+y);
 
	or:

    int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
 
	These reduction operations can run safely in parallel with almost no modification:


    int sum = numbers.parallelStream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
 
	Reduction parallellizes well because the implementation can operate on subsets of the data in parallel,
	 and then combine the intermediate results to get the final correct answer. 
	 (Even if the language had a "parallel for-each" construct, the mutative accumulation approach 
	 would still required the developer to provide thread-safe updates to the shared accumulating variable 
	 sum, and the required synchronization would then likely eliminate any performance gain from parallelism.) 
	 Using reduce() instead removes all of the burden of parallelizing the reduction operation, 
	 and the library can provide an efficient parallel implementation with no additional synchronization 
	 required.

	The "widgets" examples shown earlier shows how reduction combines with other operations to replace 
	for loops with bulk operations. If widgets is a collection of Widget objects, which have a getWeight 
	method, we can find the heaviest widget with:


     OptionalInt heaviest = widgets.parallelStream()
                                   .mapToInt(Widget::getWeight)
                                   .max();
 
	In its more general form, a reduce operation on elements of type <T> yielding a result of type <U> 
	requires three parameters:


	 <U> U reduce(U identity,
	              BiFunction<U, ? super T, U> accumulator,
	              BinaryOperator<U> combiner);
 
	Here, the identity element is both an initial seed value for the reduction and a default result 
	if there are no input elements. The accumulator function takes a partial result and the next element, 
	and produces a new partial result. The combiner function combines two partial results to produce a 
	new partial result. (The combiner is necessary in parallel reductions, where the input is partitioned, 
	a partial accumulation computed for each partition, and then the partial results are combined to produce 
	a final result.)
	More formally, the identity value must be an identity for the combiner function. This means that for 
	all u, combiner.apply(identity, u) is equal to u. Additionally, the combiner function must be 
	associative and must be compatible with the accumulator function: for all u and t, 
	combiner.apply(u, accumulator.apply(identity, t)) must be equals() to accumulator.apply(u, t).

	The three-argument form is a generalization of the two-argument form, incorporating a mapping step 
	into the accumulation step. We could re-cast the simple sum-of-weights example using the more 
	general form as follows:


     int sumOfWeights = widgets.stream()
                               .reduce(0,
                                       (sum, b) -> sum + b.getWeight())
                                       Integer::sum);
 
	though the explicit map-reduce form is more readable and therefore should usually be preferred. 
	The generalized form is provided for cases where significant work can be optimized away by 
	combining mapping and reducing into a single function.

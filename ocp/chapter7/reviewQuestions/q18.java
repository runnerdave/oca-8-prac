//<div class="ansText">The code compiles without issue, so B, C, and D are incorrect. The limit on the cyclic barrier is 10, but the stream can generate only up to 9 threads that reach the barrier; therefore the limit can never be reached, and F is the correct answer, making A and E incorrect. Note that even if the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">limit(9)</span> statement was changed to <span class="dCode dNoWrap">limit(10)</span>, the program could still hang, since the JVM might not allocate 10 threads to the parallel stream.</div>

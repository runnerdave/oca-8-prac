<div class="ansText">The application compiles and does not throw an exception, so B, C, D, E, and G are incorrect. Even though the stream is processed in sequential order, the tasks are submitted to a thread executor, which may complete the tasks in any order. Therefore, the output cannot be determined ahead of time and F is correct, making A incorrect. Finally, the thread executor is never shut down; therefore the code will run but it will never terminate, making H also correct.</div>

//The code compiles and runs without issue, so D, E, F, and G are incorrect. The key aspect to notice in the code is that a single-thread executor is used, meaning that no task will be executed concurrently. Therefore, the results are valid and predictable with <span class="dCode dNoWrap">100&nbsp;100</span> being the output, and B is the correct answer. If a pooled thread executor was used with at least two threads, then the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">sheepCount2++</span> operations could overwrite each other, making the second value indeterminate at the end of the program. In this case, C would be the correct answer.

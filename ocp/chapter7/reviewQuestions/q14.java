The methods on line 5, 6, 7, and 8 each throw <span class="dCode dNoWrap">InterruptedException</span>, which is a checked exception; therefore the method does not compile and C is the only correct answer. If the method signature was updated to include <span class="dCode dNoWrap">throws</span> <span class="dCode dNoWrap">InterruptedException</span>, then the answer would be F, because the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">deque</span> may be blocked at runtime when the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">offerFirst()</span>, <span class="dCode dNoWrap">offerLast()</span>, <span class="dCode dNoWrap">pollFirst()</span>, and <span class="dCode dNoWrap">pollLast()</span> operations are called. Finally, if they were not blocked and there were no other operations on the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">deque</span>, then the output would be <span class="dCode dNoWrap">20&nbsp;85</span>, and the answer would be A.

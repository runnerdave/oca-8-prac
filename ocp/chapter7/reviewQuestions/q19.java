The class compiles without issue so A is correct, and B and C are incorrect. The synchronized object on line <span class="dCode dNoWrap">k1</span> is <span class="dCode dNoWrap">TicketManager.class</span>, while the synchronized object on line <span class="dCode dNoWrap">k4</span> is the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">instance</span> of <span class="dCode dNoWrap">TicketManager</span>. The class is not thread-safe because the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">makeTicketsAvailable()</span> method is not synchronized, and E is incorrect. One thread could call <span class="dCode dNoWrap">sellTickets()</span> while another thread has unblocked accessed to <span class="dCode dNoWrap">makeTicketsAvailable()</span>, causing an invalid number of tickets to be reached as part of a race condition. Finally, F is correct because the class synchronizes using a <span class="dCode dNoWrap">static</span> <span class="dCode dNoWrap">getInstance()</span> method, preventing more than one instance from being created.

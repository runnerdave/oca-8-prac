<div class="ansText">The code compiles without issue, so F is incorrect. Note that the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">compute()</span> method is <span class="dCode dNoWrap">protected</span> in the parent class, although you can override it with <span class="dCode dNoWrap">public</span> without issue since this is a more accessible modifier. Since <span class="dCode dNoWrap">compute()</span> returns a value, <span class="dCode dNoWrap">RecursiveTask</span> must be inherited instead of <span class="dCode dNoWrap">RecursiveAction</span>, so C is correct and B is incorrect. The code does correctly find the minimum value on a non-empty array without entering an infinite loop, so A is correct and D is incorrect. Finally, since the code calls <span class="dCode dNoWrap">join()</span> immediately after <span class="dCode dNoWrap">fork()</span>, causing the process to wait, it does not perform any faster if there are 100 threads versus 1 thread, so E is also correct.</div>

//The code compiles and runs without issue, so G and H are incorrect. The return type of <span class="dCode dNoWrap">performCount()</span> is <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Integer</span>, so the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">submit()</span> is interpreted as being applied to a <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Callable&lt;Integer&gt;</span> value. In this manner, the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Future&lt;?&gt;</span> is really a <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Future&lt;Integer&gt;</span> object. One possible implementation of <span class="dCode dNoWrap">performCount()</span> is just to return the input parameter; therefore A is a correct answer. B is incorrect, because the return type is <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Integer</span>, not <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Boolean</span>. The <span class="dCode dNoWrap">performCount()</span> method could just return <span class="dCode dNoWrap">null</span>, so C is a correct choice. The <span class="dCode dNoWrap">performCount()</span> can also throw a runtime exception; therefore D is also a correct answer. It is also possible for our <span class="dCode dNoWrap">performCount()</span> to hang indefinitely, such as in a deadlock. This would cause <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Future.get()</span> to hang in <span class="dCode dNoWrap">printResults()</span>, making E also a correct answer. Finally, any exception thrown in <span class="dCode dNoWrap">performCount()</span> will appear as an exception in the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">get()</span> operation. Since the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">get()</span> operations are caught in a <span class="dCode dNoWrap">try/catch</span> block in <span class="dCode dNoWrap">printResults()</span>, none of them will be unhandled, and F is incorrect.

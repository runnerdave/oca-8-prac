<div class="ansText">The program compiles without issue, so B, C, and D are incorrect. Lines <span class="dCode dNoWrap">m2</span> and <span class="dCode dNoWrap">m3</span> throw a compiler warning about generics but still compile. Notice that <span class="dCode dNoWrap">RecursiveAction</span>, unlike <span class="dCode dNoWrap">RecursiveTask</span>, does not return a value. However, since we used a generic <span class="dCode dNoWrap">ForkJoinTask</span> reference, the code still compiles. The issue here is that the base condition is not reached since the numbers <span class="dCode dNoWrap">start</span>/<span class="dCode dNoWrap">end</span> are consistently positive. This causes an infinite loop, although since memory is finite, Java detects this and throws a <span class="dCode dNoWrap">StackOverflowError</span>, so E is correct. In practice, this could also generate a locking exception before the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">StackOverflowError</span> when the program runs out of memory, but in either circumstance, the program will exit.</div>

/*
From a ReadWriteLock, you can get one read lock (by calling lock.readLock() ) and one write lock (by calling lock.writeLock() ). 
Even if you call these methods multiple times, the same lock is returned. A read lock can be locked by multiple threads simultaneously 
(by calling lock.readLock().lock() ), if the write lock is free. If the write lock is not free, a read lock cannot be locked. 
The write lock can be locked (by calling lock.writeLock().lock() ) only by only one thread and only when no thread already 
has a read lock or the write lock. In other words, if one thread is reading, other threads can read, but no thread can write. 
If one thread is writing, no other thread can read or write.  

Methods that do not modify the collection (i.e. the threads that just "read" a collection) should acquire a 
read lock and threads that modify a collection should acquire a write lock.  

The benefit of this approach is that multiple reader threads can run without blocking if the write lock is free. 
This increases performance for read only operations. 

Note that if you remove the line //1, //2, //3, and //4, (i.e. if you don't use any locking), you will see a ConcurrentModificationException.

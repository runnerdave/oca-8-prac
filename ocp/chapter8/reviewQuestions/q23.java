<div class="answerContent"><p class="AnswerTxt"><b> Answer: H </b></p><div class="ansText">Not all <span class="dCode dNoWrap">java.io</span> streams support the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">mark()</span> operation; therefore, without calling <span class="dCode dNoWrap">markSupported()</span> on the stream, the result is unknown until runtime. If the stream does support the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">mark()</span> operation, then the result would be <span class="dCode dNoWrap">XYZY</span>, because the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">reset()</span> operation puts the stream back in the position before the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">mark()</span> was called, and <span class="dCode dNoWrap">skip(1)</span> will skip <span class="dCode dNoWrap">X</span>, and E would be correct. If the stream does not support the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">mark()</span> operation, a runtime exception would likely be thrown, and G would be correct. Since you don't know if the input stream supports the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">mark()</span> operation, H is the only correct choice.</div></div>

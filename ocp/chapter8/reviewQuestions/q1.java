<div class="answerContent"><p class="AnswerTxt"><b> Answer: A;D </b></p><div class="ansText">The reference is for an <span class="dCode dNoWrap">InputStream</span> object, so only a high-level input <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Stream</span> class is permitted. B is incorrect because <span class="dCode dNoWrap">FileInputStream</span> is a low-level stream that interacts directly with a file resource, not a stream resource. C and F are incorrect because you cannot use <span class="dCode dNoWrap">BufferedReader</span>/<span class="dCode dNoWrap">BufferedWriter</span> directly on a stream. E is incorrect because the reference is to an <span class="dCode dNoWrap">InputStream</span>, not an <span class="dCode dNoWrap">OutputStream</span>. A and D are the only correct options. Note that a <span class="dCode dNoWrap">BufferedInputStream</span> can be wrapped twice, since high-level streams can take other high-level streams.</div></div>

<div class="answerContent"><p class="AnswerTxt"><b> Answer: E </b></p><div class="ansText">First off, even though the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Bird</span> class implements <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Serializable</span>, it does not define a <span class="dCode dNoWrap">static</span> <span class="dCode dNoWrap">serialVersionUID</span> variable, which is recommended but not required; therefore it compiles without issue and F is incorrect. The code also runs without issue, so G is incorrect. The key here is that Java will call the constructor for the first non-serializable no-argument parent class during deserialization, skipping any constructors and default initializations for serializable classes in between, including <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Eagle</span> and <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Bird</span> itself. Therefore, <span class="dCode dNoWrap">Object()</span> is the first constructor called. All default initializations are skipped, so A, B, C, and D are all incorrect. Since the <span class="dCode dNoWrap">name</span> is marked <span class="dCode dNoWrap">transient</span>, the deserialized value is <span class="dCode dNoWrap">null</span> and E is correct. H is also incorrect, because the caller cannot change the serialized value of <span class="dCode dNoWrap">name</span> with <span class="dCode dNoWrap">setName()</span>, since <span class="dCode dNoWrap">name</span> is marked <span class="dCode dNoWrap">transient</span>.</div></div>
